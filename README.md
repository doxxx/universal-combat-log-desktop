# Universal Combat Log

A GUI application for parsing and viewing the combat logs produced by various MMORPGs including Rift and World of Warcraft. It also includes a tool for converting these log files into the UCL format used by the [Universal Combat Log iPad app](https://github.com/doxxx/universal-combat-log).

It also acts as a network server for the [Universal Combat Log iPad app](https://github.com/doxxx/universal-combat-log), providing remote access to the loaded log file.
